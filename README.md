Project title: Defeat the Dark Wizard

Project description: "Defeat the Dark Wizard" is a text-based, turn-based battle game in Python. Players can choose from different character classes, each with unique abilities, to battle against the Dark Wizard. The game includes features such as attacking, using special abilities, healing, and viewing character stats. The goal is to defeat the evil wizard before he defeats you. 

Challenges: Completing random attack damages (forgot to import random at first). Formatting in general was difficult. Using the import feature for characters was helpful for this and increasing organization.

Features I would like to implement in the future: 
1.	New characters with more diverse special abilities. 
2.	Option to play game again or quit

How to install and run the project: 
1.	Have python install on your system. 
2.	Open game code file in Python. 
3.	Run in a terminal or command prompt.   	

How to play: 
1.	Choose one of the 5 classes.      
2.	Enter the name of your character. 
3.	Choose one of four functions for your turn (attack, special ability, heal, view stats).
4.	The evil wizard will attack and regenerate health after each of your turns.
5.	The game will end when either your character or the Dark Wizard is defeated.
